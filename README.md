# tissue-gene-analysis
Classification of tissues by gene expressions using PCA
We'll try to figure out the minimum required number of PCs for a good classfication of 
tissues usin their gene expressions in experimental observations

1- preanalysis.R evaluates the PCs of the data set to show how different is their
weight.
2- analysis.R defines the number of PCs that are enough for a robust classification of tissues
3- the dataset is saved in rdas subdirectory
4- graphs are saved in fig subdirectory
